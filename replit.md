# Fundry - Equity Crowdfunding Platform

## Overview

Fundry is a full-stack equity crowdfunding platform built for Replit. It enables founders to create funding campaigns and allows investors to discover and invest in early-stage companies. The platform uses modern web technologies including React for the frontend, Express.js for the backend, PostgreSQL for data storage, and features Replit's authentication system.

## System Architecture

The application follows a modern full-stack architecture with clear separation between frontend and backend concerns:

- **Frontend**: React 18 with TypeScript, built using Vite for development and production
- **Backend**: Express.js server with TypeScript support
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM for type-safe database operations
- **Authentication**: Email/password authentication with Passport.js and PostgreSQL sessions
- **UI Framework**: Tailwind CSS with shadcn/ui component library
- **File Uploads**: Multer for handling campaign assets (logos, pitch decks)

## Key Components

### Frontend Architecture
- **React Router**: Using Wouter for client-side routing
- **State Management**: TanStack Query for server state management
- **UI Components**: Comprehensive shadcn/ui component system with Radix UI primitives
- **Form Handling**: React Hook Form with Zod validation
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom Fundry brand colors (orange/navy theme)

### Backend Architecture
- **Express.js**: RESTful API server with middleware for authentication and logging
- **Database Layer**: Drizzle ORM with Neon serverless PostgreSQL
- **Authentication**: Passport.js with OpenID Connect for Replit authentication
- **Session Management**: PostgreSQL-backed sessions with connect-pg-simple
- **File Storage**: Local file system storage for uploaded assets

### Database Schema
The database includes several key entities:
- **Users**: Stores user profiles with support for founders and investors
- **Business Profiles**: Extended information for founder accounts
- **Campaigns**: Funding campaigns with SAFE agreement terms
- **Investments**: Investment records with payment tracking
- **Sessions**: Authentication session storage

## Data Flow

1. **Authentication Flow**: Users authenticate via Replit OAuth, creating sessions stored in PostgreSQL
2. **Campaign Creation**: Founders can create campaigns with file uploads for logos and pitch decks
3. **Investment Process**: Investors browse campaigns and make investments through SAFE agreements
4. **Dashboard Views**: Role-based dashboards showing relevant metrics and data for founders vs investors

## External Dependencies

### Core Dependencies
- **@neondatabase/serverless**: Neon PostgreSQL driver for serverless environments
- **drizzle-orm**: Type-safe ORM for database operations
- **@tanstack/react-query**: Server state management and caching
- **@radix-ui/**: Comprehensive accessible UI primitives
- **passport**: Authentication middleware
- **multer**: File upload handling

### Development Tools
- **Vite**: Fast development server and build tool
- **TypeScript**: Type safety across the entire stack
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework
- **ESBuild**: Fast JavaScript bundling for production

## Deployment Strategy

The application is configured for deployment on Replit's autoscale infrastructure:

- **Development**: `npm run dev` runs the Express server with Vite middleware
- **Production Build**: `npm run build` creates optimized client bundle and server bundle
- **Production Runtime**: `npm run start` serves the built application
- **Database**: Managed PostgreSQL instance via environment variables
- **File Storage**: Local file system (uploads directory)

The deployment uses:
- Node.js 20 runtime
- PostgreSQL 16 for database
- Port 5000 for the application server
- Automatic SSL termination via Replit's proxy
