Prompt Title:
🌐 Build Fundry’s Global Admin Settings Panel for Multi-Country Fundraising

Prompt Goal:
Enable Fundry Admins to configure global platform-wide rules for investment limits, tier-based fees, country-specific KYC compliance, and regionally tailored payment processing — all dynamically controlled from a central admin dashboard, with persistent sync to Supabase.

🔧 Core Functional Requirements
1. 💸 Global Tiered Platform Fee Settings
Allow admins to define and manage platform fees based on:

Funding Goal Tiers (globally and per country):

e.g.

Tier 1 ($0 – $5,000): 0%

Tier 2 ($5,001 – $25,000): 2%

Tier 3 ($25,001 – $100,000): 4%

Country-specific overrides (e.g. Nigeria gets a 1% discount)

Multi-currency support for each tier

Auto-apply correct fee structure based on campaign goal and founder’s country

2. 🌐 Country-Based KYC & Verification Rules
Admins should:

Define different KYC levels by fundraising range per country or region

Example for Nigeria:

$0 – $5,000: Email, Phone

$5,001 – $25,000: BVN, ID upload

$25,001+: Company docs, proof of address

Example for USA:

SSN verification, IRS EIN, Gov ID

Store these in kyc_policy_settings table, enforce during campaign creation

Dynamic alerts to founders when their goal exceeds their completed KYC tier

3. 💱 Currency & Payment Processor Settings
Create a settings module that allows admins to:

Set default currency per country

Assign payment processors based on currency:

Stripe → USD, GBP, EUR

Budpay/Paystack → NGN

Flutterwave → Multi-currency fallback

Map currency conversion for UI display and backend logic

4. 📈 Fee Simulation & Preview Tool
Let Admins simulate:

Gross campaign value

Platform + processing fee deductions

Net payout in founder’s currency

This calculator should also appear in the Founder Campaign creation UI

5. 📜 Global Terms & Legal Disclaimers
Admins can:

Upload or edit Terms of Service by country

Add auto-generated markdown explanations of fees, KYC, and withdrawal timelines

Automatically require founders to acknowledge the relevant version during onboarding or campaign launch

6. 📡 Regional Settings Panel
A dynamic interface where Admins can:

Enable/disable fundraising in certain countries

Set localized thresholds (e.g., Brazil max = R$150,000, India max = ₹10L)

Choose default language per country

Save all settings in region_settings table and fetch from Supabase

7. 🧾 Tiered Withdrawal Policies (Optional)
Add optional controls for:

Disbursement timelines (e.g. “7 days after campaign close”)

Minimum withdrawal amount

Country-based bank integrations

Link to KYC compliance before release of funds

🧩 Suggested Supabase Tables:
global_fee_tiers: min_goal, max_goal, country, fee_percent, currency

kyc_policy_settings: country, tier, requirements

region_settings: country, currency, language, max_goal, is_enabled

legal_documents: country, tos_url, privacy_policy_url, disclaimer_text

payment_gateways: country, currency, gateway

🖥️ UI Section Mock-Up
